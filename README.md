Challenges:

Finding a simple yet sleek design, I used styled components for custom styling and semantic ui for cards and inputs.

●Paginating and breaking data set up - I created a load more button and a hidden paginator stored in state to calculate the next result set. I would need to implement an api request to get data sets longer than 20 and make a call after 20 are shown.

● Future design - I would display more info, size the cards better, implement simple animations and transitions, have loading and error states and icons, write more tests, grab more data from the server after 20 results.

Movie Search Challenge

●Using The MovieDB API, build a simple movie search app!
○The API key will be provided to you.
●Provide users with a fast, clear interface for searching for their favorite movies.
●Implement the application design with a mobile first approach●Features:○Allow a user to search for movies by title using the API’s ​search​ endpoint.
○Display visual results as the user types.○Add a way to handle large result sets (e.g., a load more button or infinite scroll).○Adding unit tests to test core functionality
●Recommendations for optional features (if you have extra time):○Use an alternate endpoint of the API to implement another useful feature.○Allow a user to share a link to a specific search (similar to search engine resultslike Google).
○Any feature you feel demonstrates your skillset and/or creativity.

Instructions

●Use React.js and any other supporting libraries you may need
○It’s recommended to bootstrap your app with create-react-app
●There is no backend component to this challenge.
●We’ve provided a rough wireframe for what the app might look like.
○We encourage you to deviate from the wireframe in any way you like as long asyou meet the requirements of the challenge and provides a good UX○Ideally the design is responsive and will make sense visually at multiplebreakpoints●Upload your code to a Github repository, Codesandbox, etc.
●Add a README with brief information on:○How to set up the application and dependencies○Challenges, and how you overcame them
○Reasoning behind any design decisions○Future improvements you would make with more time
●This project should be completed within 2-3 hours. Focus on the core features and onlyattempt the optional feature as time allows
